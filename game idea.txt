general:
the more coins the player acquires, the more dangerous the adventure gets (either by slowing player down or by spawning more dragons or making the coins more 'powerful', in turn making them faster in all movements - sending and retrieving them).
collecting coins gives you extra bonus coins, but you have to keep in mind that getting a high coin count will make the game more difficult. if you collect them fast, so that you get the bonus, its more risky.
